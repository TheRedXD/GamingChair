# Gaming Chair
A utility mod useful for accomplishing a large set of tasks in Minecraft.

> ### ⚠️ Very work-in-progress
> A lot of things are still not finished and may be broken, expect bugs!

## Project setup
This project is multi-versioned through [Stonecutter](https://stonecutter.kikugie.dev/), so you may need some setup for
that to work well.

Anything else should theoretically work just fine.

## Features
> Warning, may not be fully up-to-date!

### ActiveMods
Shows your active mods as a HUD.
### BetterBoat
Enables controlling your boat turning using your mouse rather than A/D keyboard controls (may not be allowed in boating 
tournaments).
### BlockHighlighter
WIP feature to highlight blocks more clearly than in vanilla.
### BoatVelocity
WIP feature to show your current velocity while in a boat by rendering a line.
### Debugger
A feature intended for use by developers in order to debug various issues in their custom mods inside Gaming Chair 
(work-in-progress)
### Hud
A HUD (Heads-Up Display) that shows the current mod version and the creator, as well as a little ASCII rendition of a 
gaming chair!
### Position
Shows your position on screen in a neat way.
### Uwuifier
It's in the name. Turns your messages into UwU speak. WIP, plans to add this to signs and a way to stop it from sending 
a message with UwU speak while holding shift.

## Mod Menu
To configure any features, you can open the Mod Menu by pressing right shift (RSHIFT).

## Recommended IDE
This project was made using the IntelliJ Idea Community Edition, so if you don't know where to start, this is something 
you can choose. **If you're going to use IntelliJ though, please do install the Stonecutter Dev plugin for IntelliJ, 
as it makes a bunch of stuff much easier.**

## Main WIP feature - Scripting
Yes, you read it right. Gaming Chair will add scripting in order to let you write your own mods for Gaming Chair. This 
is one of the primary planned features of the mod, and is currently work-in-progress.
